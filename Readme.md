# Alg123d

## Credits

Alg123d is a thin facade on top of [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d), so most of the credit goes to Roger Maitland.

## Design philosophy

1. Explicit is better than implicit
2. Minimum boilerplate
3. Interoperability with build123d and CadQuery

## Overview

Alg123d removes all implicit computations (e.g. Build contexts, Location contexts, pending*\* and last*\*) from build123d. It adds a few direct API extensions to make some statements shorter or better readable and provides a set of conversion functions.

It uses two concepts, "Object arithmetic" and "Placement at Locations"

### Object arithmetic

**Object creation**

```python
b = Box(1,2,3)
```

is an `AlgCompound` placed on the `XY` plane. It is a subclass of `build123d.Compound` and can be immediately shown and used in arithmetic operations.

**Fusing a box and a cylinder**

```python
f = Box(1,2,3) + Cylinder(0.2, 5)
```

**Cutting a cylinder from a box**

```python
f = Box(1,2,3) - Cylinder(0.2, 5)
```

**Intersecting a box and a cylinder**

```python
f = Box(1,2,3) & Cylinder(0.2, 5)
```

### Placement at locations

An `AlgCompund` does not have any location or rotation paramater. It will be relocated with the `@` operator (see below) which will then be reflected in the `location` property of the underlying `build123d.Compound`.

The generic form is `alg_compound @ (plane * location)`

-   `Box(1,2,3)`

    Box at `origin = (0,0,0)` without rotation

-   Box at `origin = (0,1,0)` without rotation:

    ```python
    b = Box(1,2,3) @ Pos((0,1,0))
    b = Box(1,2,3) @ Pos(y=1)
    ```

-   Box at `origin = (0,0,0)` with `rotation = (0, 100, 45)`:

    ```python
    b = Box(1,2,3) @ Rot((0, 100, 45))
    ```

-   Box at `origin = (0,1,0)` with `rotation = (0, 100, 45)`:

    ```python
    b = Box(1,2,3) @ Location((0,1,0), (0,100,45))
    ```

-   Box on plane `Plane.YZ`:

    ```python
    b = Box(1,2,3) @ Plane.XZ
    ```

-   Box on plane `Plane.YZ` rotated around `X` by 45Â°:

    ```python
    b = Box(1,2,3) @ (Plane.XZ * Rot(x=45))
    ```

## Overview

Alg123d consists of one class: `class AlgCompound(build123d.Compound)`

**Additional properties:**

-   `dim`: Dimensionality of the `AlgCompound a` with `a.dim in [0,1,2,3]`: 0=empty, 1=line, 2=sketch, 3=part (used to check compatibility of algebra operationes)
-   `joints`: Support build123d's `Joint` connectors directly on `AlgCompound`'s, default = `{}`
-   `mates`: Support manual assemblies with `alg123d.MAssembly`, default =`{}`
-   `metadata`: Expose metadata of an AlgCompound (e.g. sizes or distances) for later use with the compound, default = `{}` (free form dict that is not used by any CAD algorithm)

**Additional user facing operators:**

-   `+`: `(AlgCompound, AlgCompound) -> AlgCompound`: Fuse two objects
-   `-`: `(AlgCompound, AlgCompound) -> AlgCompound`: Cut first object with second object
-   `&`: `(AlgCompound, AlgCompound) -> AlgCompound`: Intersect two objects
-   `@`: `(AlgCompound, Plane|Location) -> AlgCompound`: Change absolute location of an AlgCompound

Another important operator is used from build123d:

-   `*`: `(Location, Location) -> Location`: Multiply (concatenate) two locations
-   `*`: `(Plane, Location) -> Plane`: Change location of a plane

Proxying build123d operators `position_at` and `tangent_at` to a line object (`dim==1` only)

-   `@`: `(AlgCompound, float) -> Vector`: `position_at` for AlgCompound with `dim==1`
-   `%`: `(AlgCompound, float) -> Vector`: `tangent_at` for AlgCompound with `dim==1`

**Objects:**

-   3-dim: {`Box`, `Cylinder`, `Cone`, `Sphere`, `Torus`, `Wedge`, `Bore`, `CounterBore`, `CounterSink`}
-   2-dim: {`Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Ellipse`, `Rectangle`, `Polygon`, `RegularPolygon`, `Text`, `Trapezoid`, `SlotArc`, `SlotCenterPoint`, `SlotCenterToCenter`, `SlotOverall`}
-   1-dim: {`Bezier`, `PolarLine`, `Polyline`, `Spline`, `Helix`, `CenterArc`, `EllipticalCenterArc`, `RadiusArc`, `SagittaArc`, `TangentArc`, `ThreePointArc`, `JernArc`}

**Functions:**

-   3-dim: {`extrude`, `extrude_until`, `loft`, `revolve`, `sweep`, `section`, `shell`}
-   2-dim: {`make_face`}

## Usage

### Examples

**Dice**

```python
from alg123d import *
width = 1.6
fillet_radius = 0.08
dist = 0.9
eye_radius = 0.23
eye_offset = 0.15

eye_locs = list(GridLocations(dist, dist / 2, 2, 3)) + [Pos((0, 0, 0))]

def eyes(face, ind):
    """build a compound of spheres representing the eyes of a side"""
    p = Plane(face) * Pos(z=eye_offset)  # eye offset above plane
    rv = AlgCompound()
    for loc in [eye_locs[i] for i in ind]:
        rv += Sphere(eye_radius) @ (p * loc)
    return rv

# create the actual body
dice = Box(width, width, width)
dice = fillet(dice, dice.edges(), fillet_radius)

# define sides and their eyes
sides = [
    (min_face(dice, Axis.Z), [6]),  # 1
    (max_face(dice, Axis.Z), [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),  # 6
    (min_face(dice, Axis.Y), [0, 5]),  # 2
    (max_face(dice, Axis.Y), [0, 2, 3, 5, 6]),  # 5
    (min_face(dice, Axis.X), [2, 3, 6]),  # 3
    (max_face(dice, Axis.X), [0, 2, 3, 5]),  # 4
]

# and cut out the eyes
for side in sides:
    dice -= eyes(*side)
```

**Location handling**

```python
plane = Plane.ZX

# Four rotations around Y
rotations = [Rotation(0, a, 0) for a in (0, 45, 90, 135)]

# initialize result with empty AlgCompound
s = AlgCompound()

# get four locations on a grid
for i, outer_loc in enumerate(GridLocations(3, 3, 2, 2)):

    # move the ZX plane to one of the four grid locations and rotate it aropund Y
    c_plane = plane * outer_loc * rotations[i]

    # Create a circle and place it the c_plane.
    # Fuse the result with s (hence we need to initiailize s with empty AlgCompound for the first loop)
    s += Circle(1) @ c_plane

    # Get a different amount of polar locations per loop
    for loc in PolarLocations(0.8, (i + 3) * 2):

        # place the polar location onto the c_plane
        # and create a rectangle at this location
        # cut the rectangle from s
        s -= Rectangle(0.1, 0.3) @ (c_plane * loc)

# Finally extrude each rotated circle with cuts in the circle normal direction
e = extrude(s, 0.3)
```
