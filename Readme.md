# Alg123d has been integrated int [Build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d) !!!

Further develoipment will only happen on build123d.

Some of the shortcuts do not exist, for example:

`shapelist.min(axis)` -> `shapelist.sort_by(axis).first`

`shapelist.max(axis)` -> `shapelist.sort_by(axis).last`

`faces(filter)` -> `faces().filter_by(filter)`

But the main algebra logic remains the same
